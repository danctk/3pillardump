Front End Development - Overview

Must

Follow https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/,
use semantic HTML, ensure keyboard
navigation

Validate inputs both client-side and server-side
Implement graceful error handling with user-
friendly messages

Minify assets, lazy-load images, reduce re-
renders, use CDNs

Follow OWASP guidelines, sanitise inputs, use
HTTPS

Maintain clear, version-controlled
documentation

Use structured logging, set up alerts and
dashboards

Use unit, integration, and E2E testing with
coverage reports

Ensure compatibility with Edge and other
major browsers

Share learnings via wikis, workshops, and
mentoring

Vet libraries for security, size, and maintenance

XX Must Not

Use non-semantic tags for
structure (e.g. <div> for
everything), ignore screen
reader support

Rely solely on client-side
validation or skip validation
entirely

Show raw error messages or
fail silently

Load large assets upfront,
ignore performance audits

Store sensitive data in plain
text, ignore XSS/CSRF risks

Leave code undocumented or
rely on tribal knowledge

Log sensitive data, skip
runtime monitoring

Skip tests or rely only on
manual QA

Assume all users use Chrome,
ignore cross-browser testing

Hoard knowledge or skip
onboarding documentation

Use outdated or bloated
libraries without review

>< Must Not Do
Pitfall Why to Avoid
Use <div> s for everything Reduces semantic clarity and accessibility
Hard-code styles inline Makes maintenance harder and breaks separation of concerns

Ignore performance bottlenecks Leads to slow load times and poor SEO

Skip cross-browser testing Causes inconsistent behaviour across platforms
Overuse DOM manipulation Can cause rendering bottlenecks
Neglect accessibility Excludes users with disabilities and violates standards
