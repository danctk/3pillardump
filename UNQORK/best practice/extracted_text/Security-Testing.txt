We are exploring automated pen testing with Snyk

Manual End User Testing

Our test plans are stored here:
Test plans - Test Plans
Manual UAT is carried out:

¢ Prior to any production release
¢ Post any production release

Testing Process

e Requirements received in the form of ADO Product Backlog Items, once allocated to a sprint

e Tests scripted based on the acceptance criteria within the Product Backlog Items

e Tests executed on the front end of the application — taking applicable screenshots using the facility in ADO,
or evidence of steps and outcomes

e If test is successful, ADO test is marked as Pass

e If test is unsuccessful, ADO test is marked as Fail, and a linked bug is raised from the test

e Ifa test is unable to be executed, it is marked as Blocked

e Ifatest becomes out of scope, it is marked as Not Applicable
