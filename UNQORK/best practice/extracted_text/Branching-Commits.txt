Git strategy

We follow releaseflow ~~> strategy
Commit style

Commits must be in the following format:
#<ADO Work Item number> brief-description
ie.

#1234 Brief description of the app

Branching strategy

All branches must be from main and merge to main (excluding release branches see: Parallel delivery with
independent release

Feature branches

Development is done using feature branches typically following a naming convention of one of the following
formats

feature/#<ADO Work Item number>-brief-description-separated-by-dashes
ie feature/#1234-some-description

OR

feature/#<ADO Work Item number>

ie feature/#1234

Bugfix branches

Bugfix branches must be in on of the following formats

bugfix/#<ADO Work Item number>-brief-description-separated-by-dashes

ie.

bugfix/#1234-some-description

OR

bugfix/#<ADO Work Item number>

ie bugfix/#1234

Parallel delivery with independent release

If we need to support parallel where we need to hold back work from a release:
1. Create a release/<project-name> branch from main

2. Create PRs from release/<project-name> (see Feature branches
& Bugfix branches)

3. Merge into release/<project-name>

4. When ready to release create a merge from release/<project-name> into main and release
