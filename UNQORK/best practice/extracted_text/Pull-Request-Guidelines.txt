> Comment Guidance

Developers are encouraged to comment on pull requests made by others as appropriate. This doesn't have to
be if something seems off, but to ask question about implementations, to make suggestions on alternative
approaches, or to offer praise for particular work.

In general, the original commentor should resolve the comment, not the PR author.

‘©! IQUW Bot Comments

Various forms of automated tooling may comment on a pull request as the @<43B1DAD8-C116-6FDD-807B-
SOCEF6F8BE6C> account. Usually, these comments should be addressed before a pull request is completed. In
general, subsequent runs

SonarQube Cloud

These comments are made when static analysis of the code by SonarQube detects something which may affect
the maintainability or reliability of the associated line or block.

You can view more details on the issue by clicking the "See it in SonarQube Cloud" link.

If you wish to disregard the comment, open it in the SonarQube UI and set it to either ‘False Positive’ or
‘Accepted’

comment in future. They can be added using an emoji, or in plain text.

Emoji Text Meaning
g « An idea or thought that could
. improve the commented code.
9 - A question about a decision or
. : approach
x im An error or omission that must
: be corrected.
z Praise for something unique,
* interesting or novel
> -. A note for future reference.

Notes

The comment will often include a suggestion
code block.

Usually, this should be accompanied by the
commentor marking the PR as ‘Waiting for
author’

Generally, PR's should not be merged with

unresolved comments of this type
